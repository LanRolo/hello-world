Hello, my name is Ramon Apolinario and I am a senior at the university of arizona obtaining a degree in GIS. I am 31 years old and live in Saint Louis MO. I am an Army veteran and now currently work for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. My interest in GIS came directly from my time in the military so I thought it would be a good broadening experience.
